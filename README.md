# A_Lang_Compiler

This is a compiler for a subject i had in University.

Phase5 is a VM.

-------How to run--------

1) Change into build directory(you will find this in most Phases)
2) cmake "Unix Makefiles" ..
3) make
4) use the executable

!!!Notice!!!
You need the file you get out of the compiler(Phase4)
as is(to have the .abc extension), to be able to run on VM.

Will add the language at some point in the future.
